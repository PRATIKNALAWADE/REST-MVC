The MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is a software design pattern commonly used in the development of web applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and business logic of the application, the view is responsible for presenting the data to the user, and the controller handles the user's input and updates the model and view accordingly.

The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, performing calculations, and enforcing rules and constraints. The model is independent of the user interface and communicates with both the view and the controller.

The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It generates the user interface and displays the information provided by the model. The view is passive and does not contain any logic or data manipulation. It simply renders the data in a format that can be easily understood by the user.

The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view and updates the model accordingly. It also listens for changes in the model and updates the view accordingly. The controller handles the flow of information between the model and the view, ensuring that they remain synchronized.

The MVC architecture promotes separation of concerns and modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend the application. It allows for independent development and testing of each component, resulting in a more flexible and scalable system.
